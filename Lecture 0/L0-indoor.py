#  In a file called indoor.py, implement a program in Python that prompts the user for input and then outputs that same input in lowercase.
#  Punctuation and whitespace should be outputted unchanged. 
#  You’re welcome, but not required, to prompt the user explicitly, as by passing a str of your own as an argument to input.

words = input("Greet! Would you say something?")
print(words.lower())

#注意这种“.”+“函数（）”的用法
